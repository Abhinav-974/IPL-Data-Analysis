# IPL-Data-Analysis
I use the IPL 2022 Auctions dataset to find and visualize information like number of unsold and sold players, number of players bought by each team, distribution of sold players according to their roles, like batsman, bowler, etc.
I also find out how many players per team have been retained, draft picked or picked from the auction.
I have also computed statistics like the highest amount which has been spent on a player per team, maximum price at which a player has been retained, the top 5 bowlers and their details, players who were in ateam last year but weren't sold this year.
